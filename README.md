Kinematic Calculator (Python)

A command-line physics calculator that computes basic kinematic quantities using standard equations of motion.

How to Run

Install Python 3.

Run the program:

python kinematic_calculator.py

Features

Calculate final velocity

Calculate displacement

Calculate time

Menu-driven command-line interface

How It Works

The user selects which quantity to calculate.

Required values are entered via the terminal.

The program applies standard kinematic formulas and displays the result.

Includes basic error handling (for example, zero acceleration when calculating time).
